# INTERPRETATION :

# REFERENCE LEVELS : 
# When all predictors are at their reference levels (treatment "TA", timepoint "DAY1"), 
# the estimated average analyte_value is statistically significant, indicating a strong baseline effect.

# For the timepoint "DAY8" compared to the reference timepoint, the analyte_value is marginally significant 
# (p-value just above 0.05), suggesting a trend toward significance.

# Additionally, Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are very low, indicating that the model does not explain 
# much more variance than would be expected by chance. 
# There is a relatively weak relationship between the predictors and the outcome.

# Only the intercept is statistically significant.
# The F-statistic is close to 0.05, indicating that the model is marginally significant as a whole 
# but doesnâ€™t strongly explain the variability in the response variable.

# Contrast DAY22 - DAY8 : the difference is not statistically significant.

# Print the results
print(contrast_results)

# INTERPRETATION : 

# The estimated baseline analyte_value when timepoint and treatment_group are at their reference levels is marginally significant.
# The p-value is slightly above the conventional 0.05 threshold, 
# suggesting that the baseline value is not significantly different from zero, but there is a hint of a difference.

# TREATMENT TB : The analyte_value for the treatment group "TB" is estimated to be 1108 units higher compared 
# to the reference treatment group. 
# This effect is statistically significant (p-value < 0.01), suggesting a strong difference in analyte_value for the "TB" treatment group.

# Additionally, Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are very low, indicating that the model does not explain 
# much more variance than would be expected by chance. 
# There is a relatively weak relationship between the predictors and the outcome.

# Only treatment_groupTB shows a statistically significant effect on analyte_value,
# suggesting a notable impact of this treatment group.

# The F-statistic is significant (p-value < 0.05), indicating that the model as a whole is statistically significant 
# and that at least one of the predictors contributes to explaining the variability in analyte_value.

# Contrast DAY22 - DAY8 : the difference is not statistically significant.

# INTERPRETATION :

# DAY 8 : The analyte_value is significantly higher on DAY 8 compared to the reference timepoint, 
# and this effect is highly statistically significant.

# DAY 22: The positive estimate indicates a meaningful increase in analyte_value, 
# and the p-value below 0.05 confirms that this effect is statistically significant.

# Additionally, Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are very low, indicating that the model does not explain 
# much more variance than would be expected by chance. 
# There is a relatively weak relationship between the predictors and the outcome.

# DAY8 and DAY22 have a significant impact on analyte_value, with DAY8 showing the strongest effect. 
# DAY15 is marginally significant, while DAY29 does not significantly impact analyte_value.

# The p-value of the F-statistics indicates that the overall model is statistically significant. 

# Contrast DAY22 - DAY8 : the difference is not statistically significant.
